# This is the ssh client system-wide configuration file.  See
# ssh_config(5) for more information.  This file provides defaults for
# users, and the values can be changed in per-user configuration files
# or on the command line.

# Configuration data is parsed as follows:
#  1. command line options
#  2. user-specific file
#  3. system-wide file
# Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.
# Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the
# configuration file, and defaults at the end.

# Site-wide defaults for some commonly used options.  For a comprehensive
# list of available options, their meanings and defaults, please see the
# ssh_config(5) man page.

#
# Connecting to Remote Services with Local Apps
#
# Sometimes there is a service, such as a database or a web server, which is
# available on a remote server but it would be handy to connect to it from a
# local application. This can be achieved with port forwarding. For example, if
# the db server is running Postgres (and only allows access locally) you can put
# this in your SSH config:
# 
#     Host db
#       LocalForward 5433 localhost:5432
# 
# Then when you SSH to that server it sets up port 5433 (a number I just made up)
# on your computer to forward all traffic to port 5432 (the standard Postgres
# port) on the server, and that, so far as the server is concerned, the
# connection comes from localhost.
# 
#     $ ssh db
# 
# So in another window (or after immediately exiting the shell created by the
# above command if youâ€™re using persistent connections) you can connect to the DB
# with a local Postgres client:
# 
#     $ psql -h localhost -p 5443 orders
